== About Me ==
I am an Art History and XC/TF double major at Williams College. I'm a proud Buffalonian — I cheer for the Bills and the Sabres. I take pride in the fact that Buffalo is the second largest city in New York State. In my free time, and sometimes not in my free time, I work as a visual designer and web developer. If you're bored, take a look at some of my work [http://twnsnd.co]. I honestly have found this more interesting than any of my classes and frequently consider why I am not a Comp Sci major until I realize I'm awful at math.

=== Food in Buffalo ===
I cannot do Buffalo justice when it comes to food — I am not a foodie. However, if one was visiting Buffalo, I would tell him/her to skip Niagara Falls and take a trip to both ''Duff's'' and ''The Anchor Bar'' (Photo at right). Both are fantastic venues for the mighty chicken wing [[Image:Anchor-Bar.png\right\The Anchor Bar]]. 

Beef on Kimmelweck is another one of Buffalo's local staples. These salt and caraway seed covered beauties are only made in B-Lo, and are best filled with hot roast beef and a slathering of fresh horseradish. The best is at ''Schwabl's''.

I might also suggest that you go to ''Might Taco'', for a forgettable burrito in terms of taste, but memorable in size and value; the El Niño is a force in terms of sheer ground Bovine payload. 

My favorite restaurant in Buffalo is probably ''Ming Café''. This little hole in the wall on Main Street serves up some of the best won ton soup that I've ever had. It always arrives piping hot and full of spices, especially a sinus clearing amount of ginger. The dumplings aren't half bad either. [[Image:Ming-Cafe.png\right\Ming Cafe]].

My favorite takeout is from ''Amy's Place''. This is a favorite of UB South Campus students, many of whom live on the other side of the street. The "Lentilberry Wrap" is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Served both cold and hot, its deliciously seasoned lentil and wheat berry combo will pleasantly surprise even the most adamant carnivore. Their burgers aren't half bad either.

=== Bars/Pubs in Buffalo ===
I'm not one for the bar scene in Buffalo, but here's a quick list off the top of my head based on the one's that my older friends go to:
* '''Mes Qué'''
**  Soccer bar, big rivalries are super fun to watch here. No clue about their actual beer selection. They also serve tasty food.
* '''Checkers'''
** Half gross, half awesome — everyone that lives in North Buffalo loves it. Drinks are pretty affordable. My high school friend Fran bar tends there when he is home and will occasionally put some nicer beers on tap.
* '''Cole's'''
** Absolutely amazing burgers. No idea about their selection of drinks. Great venue though, the old wooden bar is sweet.
* '''Founding Fathers'''
** Where most of my high school teachers would go. A favorite of Elmwood locals who aren't looking for an expensive Elmwood Strip Bar.
* '''Schwabl's'''
** The last of the German rathskellers in Buffalo, from what I know. Serve the best beef on kimmelweck in the city. They have an amazing old cash register. [[Image:cash-register.jpg\right\Dat Register.]]
