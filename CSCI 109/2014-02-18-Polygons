```python
square = [(-50, -50), (50, -50), (50,50), (-50, 50)]

# Three Dimesional Square
square3d = raisePoly(square)

# Create Mesh, nothing happens, lacks volume until it finds an exclosed area
m = Mesh()
# Add 3d square
m.addPoly(square3d)

```

```python
# Polygon function
cross = raisePoly(polygon(6)) # polygon six sided in XYZ space

casing = extrude(cross, translate(0, 0, 100)) # Builds into Z Dimensions

```

Prism â€” we use this if we want splines
