# 16th Century Churches

## Michelangelo Buonarotti

* **San Lorenzo**
	* facade project
	* 1516-1520
	* Michelangelo proposed a more richer sculptural facade based on Alberti's Santa Maria Novella and Brunelleschi's San Lorenzo.
	* snycopated pylasters
	* *applying classical elements to Christian churches always yields a problem of masking the elements behind it*
* **San Lorenzo**
	* Medici Chapel
	* 1520-1534
	* Summary:
		* clearly begun earlier, still had square plan of Old Sacristy
		* fusion of sculpture and architecture
		* classical elements: post and lintel doors, grey pilaster with insets and pilaster pairs
			* jams the original grey pilasters of Brunelleschi with his own white pilasters extended above the post and lintel doors
			* pediment pushes forward slightly and and expands, crowding the corinthian pilasters
				* intense conflict of black and white
				* frieze offers sense of relief, above are shorter and skinnier pylasters â€” architecture falls away
				* windows inset in the pendentive zone
			* programmatic ascension from conflicted elements to release into the "heavenly vision" where the conflicts are resolved in pure geometry
				* shows the psychological approach to Michelangelo's architecture
		* Florentine grey and white marble
* **St. Peter's**
	* Rome
	* 1546
	* *Summary:*
		* expanding out from cross in to transepts and knave
		* Originally was to be redone by Sangallo the Younger, but he convoluted the greek cross
			* thought in terms of layers, like a cake, to attend to the verticality of a building
		* Michelangelo intended to transform the Sangallo redesign 
			* puts in an inert base for the dome
				* eases pairs of co,umps which buttress the dome and create a similar experience to the lower level
			* does not take layered approach
			* corinthian pilasters rhythmically surround the lower portion
			* strong curving lintel
			* great coffered dome
				* dome is hemispherical
				* exterior columns are buttressing system, but mostly contained by the iron chain within the dome itself
				* seems unfinished, as he would never do the top until he figured out the lower portion
				* incredibly tall, ambitious dome
				* did della Porto willingly change the design?
* **Santa Maria Maggiore, Sforza Chapel**
	* Rome
	* 1558
	* Summary:
		* early Christian Church, one one of the primary basilicas of Rome
		* chapel rises high above the aisle roof to let in daylight
		* square center with corners marked with diagonally placed columns, inset in circular room
			* shallow alters with curving segmental walls
			* columns strangely tucked in at angles
			* pilasters parallel the columns
			* hard to know where the barriers are
			* courtyard beside it lets in light
		* parts are held together sparingly, seemingly distinct and only matching in style, not geometry
		* 
* * dome is hemispherical
	* 1559
	* projects
	* Church of the Florentines in Rome
	* Summary:
		* traditional centrally planned format
		* cross in square church, long history in Byzantine Empire
		* square crossing, 4 cross arms, small squares in corner.
		* final version shows the radial structure, emanates power of geometry
			* square center
			* pairs of columns create circle
			* secondary circle inset with chapels
			* projections of doorways mark the axes of the church cross
			* walls are quite thick, thrust out of the church
			*
