        * transepts could not extend much beyond where they are as the street is in the way
        * Rome must approve all Church designs of the Jesuits as they are commissioned by the Pope

            * recessed wings to either side obscuring side chapels
            * volute rises from the edges to further cover the side chapels
            * _della Porta_ puts more emphasis on the hierarchy of the facade, building towards the center
                * this must have profoundly influenced and itnerested Farnese
                * trianguler pediment punctures semicircular element that risings  from flanking corinthian style pylasters, which also steps forward
                    * this pediment is echoed below in the door, and above in a large window that lightens the knave
            * calmed second level
                * pylasters are less three dimensional, but still placed in pairs
                    * no longer slide beneath the other pylasters

## Andrea Palladio
Most famous for his villas, Andrea Palladio formed a reputation for fantastic fusions of classical architecture with a hint of Renaissance taste and Baroque scale. He designed *almost exclusively in Northern Italy*. Began as a stonecutter in Padua, but was sponsored by a local aristocrat to learn Latin, architecture, etc. He was introduced to the major architecture of his own time as well as of ancient Rome. He *knew* ancient architecture very well, but also was exposed to Bramante and Michelangelo.
