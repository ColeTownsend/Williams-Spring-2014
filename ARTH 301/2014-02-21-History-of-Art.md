# How Do We See Art History

## Initial Thoughts/Questions
* __Modernism__ — How do we define it?
* What is the __future__ of Art History?
* I thought the readings reinforced the Western dominant perception of Art and Art History, and dismissed Eastern and African art in the historical sesne. It was acknowledge that modern art often appropriates many cultures into an exhibit or collection in a more "politically correct" way. 
* Why is accessibility bad?
* Individualism: how do artists define themselves amongst others with similar styles or that fall into similar trends
* Individual vs. Canon
* Why do we lack a modern movement


## Why do we equate the commodification of art as the "end of art history" or the "end of art"?
* art has always been a commodity, it is commisioned then created
    * very infrequently are studied works of art created just for fun
    * the best pieces were sponsored, as in our society most do not have the means of producing art without some way of supporting their lifestyle
        * the barrier to entry for creation has been lowered, and therefore the barrier for collection has been lowered
        * does this mean that it is no longer art, or a lower form of art?
            * what seperates cheaper art from decoration or simply product in the case of Duchamp and Warhol?
                * Duchamp vs. Picasso
    * the diversity of the "market" has yielded a diversity in product and art

* Before we had self-conscience art, it was fxnl, not conceived as "in the museum"
* Art today, is produced with consumption and commodification in mind. How do I sell this piece?

## Melville on Methods & Art History Education
* The "Methods" course is imposed by outside administrators?

## How did our approach at Williams fit into the structures of Elkins or Melville
* thought in terms of western art
    * we perceive other art forms in styles of Western art movements
* Eastern Art is categorized by Dynasties
    * no such clear definition for movements
    * resort to historical references, cultural categories because style alone cannot categorize
* How do we unlearn this way of thinking, how do we untrain our eyes to see a piece of art without immediately placing it in a style, movement, or chronological period?
    * we are trained to do this for years, this is the only way we learn art

## Why Are We Learning Art History
* to impress people?
* to have an understanding of art

## Elkins
* Are We In The Post Art World?
  - prompted by Duchamp or Warhol

* How has our relationship with Art changed?
  * we are closer to production
  * we are closer to the "tastemakers"
  * we teach/learn about contemporary art

## Subjectivity vs. Objectivity in Art History
* art history is always reflective of the current discourse
    * it is applied retroactively and changes as culture changes
* striving to "correct" and reduce subjectivity
* Panovfsky suggests you can apply different subjectivities to an artist's painting
* Filipczak
    * unaware of comparison or context — we can have a subjective reaction, an uneducated subjective reacion
# Questions
## Belting
* epilogues — not resolving anything
